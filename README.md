## Welcome to my page

<p>My name is Jocelyn Robertson and I am a Senior at Elizabeth City State University. My major is Computer Science with a concentration in Information Systems. </p>

<p>This is my story in choosing Computer Science as a major. I am very hard-working and dedicated person when it comes to completing my work and getting it done. I set daily goals for myself to get accomplished and Time Management is a main priority . I became interested with technology since I was 12 years old because I wanted to learn about troubleshooting computers and learning how to build a computer. I was always on the internet looking up the latest technology that have came out and the information associated with it. Now, I have a strong interest in dealing with making websites because in my spare time I am always learning to make pages I created look more interesting and user friendly for some one to use . I am experienced in HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, and SQL. I am open to learning more programming languages and gaining valuable experiences as well. My future goals are becoming a Front-End Developer or Software Developer . </p>
